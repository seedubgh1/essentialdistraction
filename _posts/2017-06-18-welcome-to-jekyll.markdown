Greetings and welcome!

Essential Distraction is meant to be an exploration into the realm of games and other past times.  What makes this unique (who am I kidding, everyone is doing it) is that the focus is around voice interaction, i.e., Alexa, Google Assistant, API.AI, and other natural language processing and 'AI' technologies.  We want to make voice interaction as exciting and delightful as it is in the movies. Perhaps we can extend the usefulness beyond ordering pizza and shopping on Amazon.  Those are great things but after you've ordered your third pizza, then what? 

There are lots of ideas in the works so check back for new and improved stuff!  Did you like Movie Geek?  What did you like about it?  What would make it better? Don't be shy, but don't be cruel either.  We are always looking for a fresh perspective on voice driven experiences.
