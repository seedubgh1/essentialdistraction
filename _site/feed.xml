        <title>Welcome to Essential Distraction!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Greetings and welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essential Distraction is meant to be an exploration into the realm of voice interaction, i.e., Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice driven technologies.  We want to make voice interaction as exciting and delightful as it is in the movies. Perhaps we can extend it’s usefulness beyond ordering pizza, shopping on Amazon, and turning on the lights.  Those are great things but after you’ve ordered your third pizza, then what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ideas in the works so check back for new and improved stuff!  Did you like Movie Geek?  What did you like about it?  What would make it better? Don’t be shy, but don’t be cruel either.  We are always looking for a fresh perspective on voice driven experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for stopping by, We’re excited to get to work on building new and exciting ways to the capture the power of your voice!&lt;/p&gt;
